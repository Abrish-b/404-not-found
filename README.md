Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

This a Dev-Challenges project for 404 error landing page 
this was great for me specially showing me how to make a page 
from a figma down to pixel perfect static page.

I used firebase hosting since it's easy to setup and manage but also
free.

I suggest for someone building this website to avoid using static numbers
for padding and margin. if you can help it avoid it beacause it will 
drastically improve Responsivensess.
